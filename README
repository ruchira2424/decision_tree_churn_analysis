Decision Tree Churn Analysis

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook for Task 3 of my Machine Learning practice, focusing on predicting customer churn using a telecom dataset with a Decision Tree Classifier.

📌 Project Description

In this task, I worked on:

Loading and preprocessing the churn dataset

Encoding categorical variables

Training a Decision Tree Classifier

Visualizing the tree structure

Evaluating performance using accuracy, F1-score, and classification report

The goal was to understand how Decision Trees classify churn, analyze performance, and identify possible overfitting.

📂 Files

Decision_tree(churning).ipynb → Main Jupyter Notebook containing the workflow

churn-bigml-80.csv → Training dataset (80%)

churn-bigml-20.csv → Testing dataset (20%)

📊 Results

Training accuracy: 100% (possible overfitting)

Test accuracy: ~90%

⚙️ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the required dependencies (see requirements.txt):

pandas (for data manipulation)

numpy (for numerical operations)

matplotlib (for visualization)

scikit-learn (for preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)

jupyter (for running notebooks
