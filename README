# 🌳 Decision Tree Churn Analysis - Machine Learning Task  

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook for **Task 3** of my Machine Learning practice, focused on building and evaluating a **Decision Tree Classifier** for customer churn prediction.  

## 📌 Project Description  
The notebook demonstrates:  
- Loading and preprocessing the churn dataset  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier  
- Visualizing the decision tree structure  
- Evaluating performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  

## 📂 Files
