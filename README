# Decision Tree Churn Analysis

A machine learning project using a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing customer churn using a Decision Tree algorithm. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to churn and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Dataset

- **Training Data:** `churn-bigml-80.csv` (80% of data)
- **Test Data:** `churn-bigml-20.csv` (20% of data)

The datasets include customer behavior and demographic features relevant to churn prediction.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Training a Decision Tree classifier
- Visualizing the decision tree
- Evaluating with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruchira2424/decision_tree_churn_analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(You may need to create a `requirements.txt` with: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)*

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open `decision_tree(churning).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, and follow the steps to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Usage

- Update dataset paths as needed in the notebook.
- Run each cell step by step to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics. You can visualize feature importances and the decision tree structure.
