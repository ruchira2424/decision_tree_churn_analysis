# Decision Tree Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn. The dataset is pre-split into training and testing files.

## Files

* `Decision_tree(churning).ipynb` — main notebook
* `churn-bigml-80.csv` — training dataset
* `churn-bigml-20.csv` — testing dataset

## Steps in the Notebook

1. Load training and testing data.
2. Encode categorical variables.
3. Train a Decision Tree classifier.
4. Visualize the tree.
5. Evaluate with accuracy, F1-score, and classification report.

## Results

* Training accuracy: 100% (possible overfitting)
* Test accuracy: \~90%

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Decision_tree(churning).ipynb
```

## Requirements

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* jupyter
