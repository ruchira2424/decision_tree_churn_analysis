# Decision Tree Churn Analysis - Machine Learning Task

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook for Task 3 of my Machine Learning practice, focused on building and evaluating a "Decision Tree Classifier" for customer churn prediction.

## Project Description

In this task, I worked on:
- Loading and preprocessing the churn dataset
- Encoding categorical variables
- Training a Decision Tree classifier
- Visualizing the decision tree structure
- Evaluating performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

The goal is to understand the ML workflow and improve model performance. The notebook uses a Decision Tree model to predict churn based on features like customer behavior and demographics.
